![Deep learning](./Artificial-intelligence-Deep-Learning.png)

## Overview

This repository contains my implementation of a basic image classification project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques. It serves as a foundational exploration of deep learning for image-related tasks.

## Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of CNNs for classifying images, utilizing well-known architectures and transfer learning methodologies. This approach allows for efficient training on smaller datasets by leveraging pre-trained models.

## Key Features

- **Convolutional Neural Networks**: Implementation of CNN architectures for effective feature extraction and classification.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) to improve performance on new datasets with limited samples.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applied techniques to enhance the dataset and improve model generalization.
- **Metrics Monitoring**: Integrated with Weights & Biases (WandB) for tracking training metrics and visualizations.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Matplotlib, WandB
- **Datasets**: MNIST, Cifar10, Cifar100, FashionMNIST, ASL_Alphabet
